      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>Italian coffee-flavoured dessert.</p>

      <h2>Ingriedients</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>568ml pot double cream</li>
          <li>250g tub mascarpone</li>
          <li>75ml marsala</li>
          <li>5 tbsp golden caster sugar</li>
          <li>300ml strong coffee, made with 2 tbsp coffee granules and 300ml boiling water</li>
          <li>175g pack sponge fingers</li>
          <li>25g dark chocolate</li>
          <li>2 tsp cocoa powder</li>
        </ul>
      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Put the double cream, mascarpone, marsala and golden caster sugar in a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Whisk until the cream and mascarpone have completely combined and have the consistency of thickly whipped cream.</li>
        <li>Pour the coffee into a shallow dish. Dip in a few of the sponge fingers at a time, turning for a few seconds until they are nicely soaked, but not soggy. Layer these in a dish until youâ€™ve used half the sponge fingers, then spread over half of the creamy mixture.</li>
        <li>Using the coarse side of the grater, grate over most of the dark chocolate. Then repeat the layers (you should use up all the coffee), finishing with the creamy layer.</li>
        <li>Cover and chill for a few hours or overnight. Will keep in the fridge for up to two days. </li>
        <li>To serve, dust with the cocoa powder and grate over the remainder of the chocolate.</li>
    
      </ol>
